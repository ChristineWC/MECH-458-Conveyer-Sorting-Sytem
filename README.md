# MECH-458-Conveyer-Sorting-Sytem

The primary objective of the project was to accurately sort objects of different materials by controlling the various sensors and motors making up the conveyor sorting mechanism. 

There were two main project specifications. As items were manually loaded onto the running conveyor belt, the system had to be able to correctly identify and accurately sort the items into their respective bin. If the system was paused, the number of sorted items of each material as well as the pending number of items still on the conveyor belt that passed through a sensor station must be displayed on the LCD. A second press of the pause button should resume object processing.
